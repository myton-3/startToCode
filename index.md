Welcome to my mock portfolio for OSU's Start to Code with Swift course.

### About Me
- Engineer
- Soccer Player
- Amateur Developer

I graduated from OSU in 2016 with a degree in Materials Science and Engineering with a minor in Microbiology. My coding journey started my junior year of high school where I took a course learning C++. From then, I've been fascinated with programming as a form of expression and productivity. 


# The course so far...
I think the course has been structured pretty well so far. I've learned syntax of other programming languages, but this course is adding in the concepts of how to get a job as a developer and the different non-coding skills necessary to do so. I like the fact has taken the time to create a formalized course granting a certificate, and I plan on taking the Pearson Swift Certification upon completetion of the program.
